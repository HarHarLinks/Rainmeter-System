## System

This is a ismple and graphically minimalistic System Monitor Skin for [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/).

## Installation

`git clone` this repo to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins`. Restart Rainmeter/refresh all skins. Select the Skins you want.

Usage should be mostly straightforward, but you can always have a look at the ini and fiddle with some details.
To use the Disk Skin, create a folder with the drive letter you want a Disk Monitor for and copy the Disk.ini into that folder. Refresh skins and select your Disk Monitor skin in the new subfolder.
